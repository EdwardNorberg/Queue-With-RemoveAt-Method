# Queue-With-RemoveAt-Method
Project from course in Algorithms and Data Structures.

Assignment was as follows: "Implement a generalized queue which allows the user to remove the kth element from the queue. Assume the most recently added element has index 1. You should print the content of the list after each insertion/deletion of an element."

To save time, this assignment allowed us to borrow code from Algoritms by Sedgewick & Wayne. Because of this, Queue, linked lists, and node implementations are all loosely inspired by the ones from Sedgewick & Wayne.
